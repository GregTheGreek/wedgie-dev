# Files dropped on the WEDGIE drive (wedgiedrive.py), read as request lines: a phone (or any computer)
# that can save a file but has no serial port talks to a wedgie this way. A host-written file in the
# drive's top folder is fed, byte by byte, through the one USB line reader (wedgie.lines(): no new
# buffer), so each of its lines is handled exactly like one from USB serial, with the same rules: any
# job still needs a real press of the green button on the wedgie. Answers go out on USB serial as usual, and once a request
# came in through a file, into ANSWER.TXT too (answer(): a phone can't read the serial port).
#
# Imported only once the host has written something (wedgie._dropped). A file is read once per power-up
# (and again if it's saved again: a new time or size); a file starting with a 0 byte (a Mac's ._ file) is
# skipped. Writes are taken only after the host has been quiet for SETTLE ms, so a file is read whole.
# A file read whole gives its written sectors back at once (_free, 0.3.41): the RAM holds 12, and waiting for
# the host's delete (an iPhone holds deletes in its cache) left a big transaction's third piece no room.
